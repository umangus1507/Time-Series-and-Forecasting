# Time-Series-and-Forecasting
## Time Series Forecasting for Shampoo Sales

# Project Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for a comprehensive time series forecasting project focused on predicting shampoo sales for a major company. The project utilizes historical sales data spanning three years, from January 2021 to December 2023, to develop accurate and reliable forecasts for the upcoming two years, up to December 2024.

 Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Thoroughly analyze the historical sales data to identify patterns, trends, and any seasonality. Perform data preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering.

2. **Model Selection and Development:** Evaluate various time series forecasting models, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet, to identify the most suitable approach for predicting shampoo sales. Implement and fine-tune the selected model based on the characteristics of the dataset.

3. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the chosen forecasting model using appropriate metrics. Validate the model against a holdout set to ensure its effectiveness in capturing the underlying patterns in the data.

4. **Forecasting Future Sales:** Utilize the trained model to generate forecasts for shampoo sales for the next two years, providing insights into expected sales trends and potential peak periods.

5. **Visualization and Interpretation:** Create visualizations that effectively communicate the forecasted results. These visual aids will help stakeholders understand the predicted sales patterns and make informed decisions.

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`data/`:** Contains the historical sales data for the past three years and any intermediate datasets created during preprocessing.

- **`notebooks/`:** Jupyter notebooks detailing the step-by-step process of data exploration, model development, and evaluation.

- **`src/`:** Source code for functions, classes, and utilities used in the project.

- **`models/`:** Saved models and model-related files for reproducibility.

- **`visualizations/`:** Graphical representations of the forecasted sales data, including time series plots, trend analyses, and model performance visualizations.

- **`documentation/`:** Project documentation, including a README file outlining the project, its objectives, and instructions for running the code.

### Getting Started

To reproduce the results or extend the analysis, follow the instructions in the README file to set up the environment, install dependencies, and execute the code.

 Future Work

This project lays the foundation for ongoing improvements and optimizations. Future work may involve exploring advanced forecasting techniques, incorporating external factors that could impact sales, and continuously refining the model as new data becomes available.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and provide feedback. Your collaboration is valuable in enhancing the accuracy and robustness of the forecasting model.
